**IMPORTANT**

Do not move any files in this directory. 


While it is possible to use these programs directly, it is unnecessary. There is 
an easy to use Perl interface provided with Transposome for accessing these methods 
in your own Perl code. Also, all of these clustering methods are implemented in the 
program `transposome`, so there is no need to write any code or interact with 
these programs directly in order to access these methods.
