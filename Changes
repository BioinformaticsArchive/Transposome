Revision history for Transposome

Version	Date	Location
0.07.2	5/27/2014	Athens, GA

- Complete redesign of main application for faster loading.
- Remove string eval of version causing issues on some machines.

0.07.1	5/19/2014	Athens, GA

- Fix typo in logging clustering results.
- Delete commented out types in SeqUtil class since tests are passing.

0.07	5/04/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method for incorporating singleton repeat sequences into
  annotation summary (changes API).
- Add explicit check if repeat database and sequence file exist.
- Move custom types to separate types library.
- Add tests for missing files that are required.

0.06	4/25/2014	Athens, GA

- Change from using YAML to YAML::Tiny for parsing configuration.
  This gives faster loading with less memory usage.
- Rename methods for parsing/getting configuration so there is no
  ambiguity about which class methods are being called.
- Add option to get version.
- Modify option handling to generate usage faster, and 
  not try to parse the configuration by default.
- Bug fix for calculationg repeat percentage of singletons.
- Clean up file creation methods for all test.

0.05	4/17/2014	Athens, GA

- Rework CI build system by isolating build and tests, which
  are now working as expected.
- Update package names in dependency list so there are no warnings
  during install.
- Changed logic for checking dependencies when testing so required programs 
  can be in any custom location.
- Changed locations searched for clustering code so any type of installation
  should work now. In particular, using local::lib or a custom lib path should
  work just the same as a default installation.

0.04	4/08/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method for writing FASTA file of singleton sequences (changes API).
- Add method for annotating and logging repeat content
  of singleton sequences (changes API).
- Add BerkeleyDB indexing method for finding pairs.
- Add portable methods for working with files and paths.

0.03	12/19/2014	Athens, GA

- Add CI support and include instructions for installing deps.
- Modified method for setting path to blast executables so there
  is nothing custom about the install.

0.02	12/02/2013	Athens, GA

- Add method signatures (via Method::Signatures).
- Bug fixes and code clean up for annotation summary method.
- Rework next_seq method in SeqIO class to build fh instead of
  taking one as an option. This is much more familiar to use, though
  considerably slower according to my benchmarks.

0.01	10/01/2013	Athens, GA

Initial release.
