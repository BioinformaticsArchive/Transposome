Version	Date	Location

- Change from using YAML to YAML::Tiny for parsing configuration.
  This gives faster loading with less memory usage.
- Rename methods for parsing/getting configuration so there is no
  ambiguity about which class methods are being called.
- Add option to get version.
- Modify option handling to generate usage faster, and 
  not try to parse the configuration by default.
- Bug fix for calculationg repeat percentage of singletons.
- Clean up file creation methods for all test.

0.05	4/17/2014	Athens, GA

- Rework CI build system by isolating build and tests, which
  are now working as expected.
- Update package names in dependency list so there are no warnings
  during install.
- Changed logic for checking dependencies when testing so required programs 
  can be in any custom location.
- Changed locations searched for clustering code so any type of installation
  should work now. In particular, using local::lib or a custom lib path should
  work just the same as a default installation.

0.04	4/08/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method for writing FASTA file of singleton sequences (changes API).
- Add method for annotating and logging repeat content
  of singleton sequences (changes API).

0.03	12/19/2014	Athens, GA

- Add CI support and include instructions for installing deps.
- Modified method for setting path to blast executables so there
  is nothing custom about the install.

0.02	12/02/2013	Athens, GA

- Add method signatures (via Method::Signatures).
- Bug fixes and code clean up for annotation summary method.
- Rework next_seq method in SeqIO class to build fh instead of
  taking one as an option. This is much more familiar to use, though
  considerably slower according to my benchmarks.
