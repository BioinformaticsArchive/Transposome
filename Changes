Revision history for Transposome

Version	Date	Location
0.07.9

- Rework test framework to be under the Transposome namespace. This
  will make maintenance and adding new features/tests much simpler.
  This also avoids hardcoding paths in test files or manually add the
  include paths.
- Add mgblast executable for Linux to be installed, which will keep
  users (at least on Linux) from having to compile this by hand.
- Remove use of BLAST+ for annotation since this required both
  Legacy BLAST (for the use of formatdb) and BLAST+ to be present.
  At this release, only Legacy BLAST is required (for annotation
  and for formatting the database for the all-vs-all search).

0.07.8	11/05/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Remove use of BerkeleyDB for indexing methods and use SQLite
  instead. This makes installation easier as the BerkeleyDB module
  required C libraries installed at the system level. Also, this change
  adds a major improvement in performance for large data sets.
- Fix dependencies listed in Makefile (YAML was listed, though it is
  no longer used).
- Add binary for mgblast for CI testing. This solves two main issues, 1)
  we don't have to rely on remote servers for getting deps, and 2) the 
  build process is about 10X faster now. The latter point means that
  adding/removing features should be painless now, instead of waiting a
  long time to get test results.

0.07.7	9/25/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Update deps to include stable version of MooseX-Getopt-Usage
  on CPAN.

0.07.6	9/23/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Add tied hash indexing method to Pairfinder class. This allowed
  the code to be reduced by almost half as compared to using a tied
  object for indexing.
- Add developmental release of MooseX-Getopt-Usage which fixes a 
  bug for Moose 2.014 (because this fix involves some trickery requiring
  cpanm, no release will be made for this version).
- Add import for main_community.cpp file that will allow compilation on
  Debian machines without editing the code.

0.07.5	8/19/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Add support for FASTQ format in main application. Prior versions
  would only handle FASTA for doing the self comparison, though the
  *SeqIO class would handle FASTQ.

0.07.4	8/15/2014	Vancouver, BC

- Modify graph-naming scheme (doesn't impact performance).
- Add DOI to make repo citable, until the manuscript is 
  published.
- Check if all vs. all blast was successful, otherwise
  exit from application or check if input is empty when
  constructing Transposome::Pairfinder object (so both
  application and API methods should handle this case).

0.07.3	6/03/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method to evaluate if classes in main application can
  be loaded.

0.07.2	5/27/2014	Athens, GA

- Complete redesign of main application for faster loading.
- Remove string eval of version causing issues on some machines.

0.07.1	5/19/2014	Athens, GA

- Fix typo in logging clustering results.
- Delete commented out types in SeqUtil class since tests are passing.

0.07	5/04/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method for incorporating singleton repeat sequences into
  annotation summary (changes API).
- Add explicit check if repeat database and sequence file exist.
- Move custom types to separate types library.
- Add tests for missing files that are required.

0.06	4/25/2014	Athens, GA

- Change from using YAML to YAML::Tiny for parsing configuration.
  This gives faster loading with less memory usage.
- Rename methods for parsing/getting configuration so there is no
  ambiguity about which class methods are being called.
- Add option to get version.
- Modify option handling to generate usage faster, and 
  not try to parse the configuration by default.
- Bug fix for calculationg repeat percentage of singletons.
- Clean up file creation methods for all test.

0.05	4/17/2014	Athens, GA

- Rework CI build system by isolating build and tests, which
  are now working as expected.
- Update package names in dependency list so there are no warnings
  during install.
- Changed logic for checking dependencies when testing so required programs 
  can be in any custom location.
- Changed locations searched for clustering code so any type of installation
  should work now. In particular, using local::lib or a custom lib path should
  work just the same as a default installation.

0.04	4/08/2014	Athens, GA

- Add method for writing FASTA file of singleton sequences (changes API).
- Add method for annotating and logging repeat content
  of singleton sequences (changes API).
- Add BerkeleyDB indexing method for finding pairs.
- Add portable methods for working with files and paths.

0.03	12/19/2014	Athens, GA

- Add CI support and include instructions for installing deps.
- Modified method for setting path to blast executables so there
  is nothing custom about the install.

0.02	12/02/2013	Athens, GA

- Add method signatures (via Method::Signatures).
- Bug fixes and code clean up for annotation summary method.
- Rework next_seq method in SeqIO class to build fh instead of
  taking one as an option. This is much more familiar to use, though
  considerably slower according to my benchmarks.

0.01	10/01/2013	Athens, GA

Initial release.
