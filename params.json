{"name":"Transposome","tagline":"Annotation of transposable element families from unassembled sequence reads","body":"### What is Transposome?\r\n\r\nTransposome is a command line application to annotate [transposable elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) from paired-end whole genome shotgun data. There are many tools to estimate the mathematical nature of repeats from short sequence reads. There are also a number of tools for analyzing repeats directly from a genome assembly. This tool allows you to infer the abundance of repeat types in the genome without a reference genome sequence. The output files make it easy to quickly summarize genomic abundance by transposable element class, superfamily, family, or any other level of the repeat taxonomy.\r\n\r\nThere is also a Perl API which allows you to build custom analysis pipelines, repeat stages of the analysis, or test a range of parameter values for each phase of Transposome (see the [Tutorial](https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/wiki/Tutorial) page for more information).\r\n\r\n**DEPENDENCIES**\r\n\r\nTo use this package, you will need Perl version 5.12 (or greater) installed and a few external programs. See the [Installing dependencies](https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/wiki/Installing-dependencies) page for a walk through of how to install the dependencies. \r\n\r\n**INSTALLATION**\r\n\r\nThe recommened method to satisfy the Perl dependencies is to install [cpanminus](http://search.cpan.org/~miyagawa/App-cpanminus-1.6935/lib/App/cpanminus.pm), and run the following command:\r\n\r\n    cpanm git://github.com/sestaton/Transposome.git\r\n\r\nIf you run into any installation issues, it may be necessary to download the code and install manually (see the [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/wiki/Troubleshooting) page for more information):\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome.git\r\n    cd Transposome\r\n    cpanm --installdeps .\r\n    perl Makefile.PL\r\n    make\r\n    make test\r\n    make install\r\n\r\nUpdating your installation can be achieved by simply running the same commands.\r\n\r\n**BASIC USAGE**\r\n\r\nFollowing installation, fill out the sample configuration file in the 'config' directory\r\nin the Transposome distribution, specifying the location of data files and parameters for analysis.\r\n\r\nThen, simply run the `transposome` program, specifying your configuration file:\r\n\r\n    transposome --config transposome_config.yml\r\n\r\nThe name of the configuration file does not matter, this is just an example. Though, the format is important. See the [Quick Start](https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/wiki/Quick-Start) wiki page for more details.\r\n\r\n**ADVANCED USAGE**\r\n\r\nIt is possible to run only one part of the Transposome package, the clustering methods for example, or create \r\nyour own analysis methods to plug into Transposome. In addition, you can extend existing methods.\r\n\r\nFor all available methods, simply type `perldoc` followed by the name of the class you are interested in \r\nusing. For example,\r\n\r\n    perldoc Transposome::Cluster\r\n\r\nAvailable classes are: \r\n\r\n    Transposome::Annotation\r\n    Transposome::Cluster\r\n    Transposome::PairFinder\r\n    Transposome::SeqIO\r\n    Transposome::SeqUtil\r\n    Transposome::Run::Blast\r\n                      \r\n\r\n**SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION**\r\n\r\nAfter installing, you can find documentation for the Transposome package with the\r\n`perldoc` command.\r\n\r\n    perldoc Transposome\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested in using Transposome programmatically or inspecting the class methods, simply type\r\n`perldoc` followed by the name of main program to run the full analysis.\r\n\r\n    perldoc transposome \r\n\r\nThe `transposome` program will also print a diagnostic help message when executed with no arguments.\r\n\r\nYou can also look for information at:\r\n\r\n    Transposome wiki\r\n        https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/wiki\r\n\r\n    Transposome issue tracker\r\n        https://github.com/sestaton/Transposome/issues\r\n\r\n**LICENSE AND COPYRIGHT**\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2013 S.
